Hi <%= @msg.questionnaire_participant.employee.first_name %>
Dear All,
As part of the development of ICL's management teams, the GEC has recently approved a plan to promote and encourage diversity in the
organization. The objective which was defined in the program is changing the perception and the organizational culture regarding gender aspects.
The first step in this program will include the data collection followed by recommendations that will be submitted to the GEC for approval.
During this step we will examine some work processes in the organization, deliver questionnaires to a selected team of managers and conduct
personal interviews with some of the senior leaders.
I would like to ask for your participation in this first step of the evaluation. Below you will find a link to an online questionnaire
containing four questions, please take five minutes of your time to complete this questionnaire as soon as you can.
The questionnaire should be opened from your smartphone device and not from a desktop or laptop computer.
To begin the questionnaire copy and paste the following link in your mobile browser:

Thank you,
Malka Nir
